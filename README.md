#Boto3
##Boto3, the next version of Boto, is now stable and recommended for general use.
##It can be used side-by-side with Boto in the same project, so it is easy to start using
##Boto3 in your existing projects as well as new projects. Going forward, API updates and all new
##feature work will be focused on Boto3.
