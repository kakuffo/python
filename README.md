## Continuous monitoring


## Infrastructure management approach
Infrastructure as a code (IaC) is an infrastructure management approach that makes continuous delivery and DevOps possible.

## Access Key
Your credentials can be passed into the methods that create connections. Alternatively, boto will check for the existence of the following environment variables to ascertain your credentials:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Your AWS Access Key ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Your AWS Secret Access Key

Credentials and other boto-related settings can also be stored in a boto config file. See this for details.
